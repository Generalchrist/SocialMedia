## What is this project about?
This project is a simple Angular application that displays a list of social media accounts and allows the user to search, filter and add social media accounts. The application uses the devExtreme library to display the social media accounts and Tailwind CSS for styling.

## My Approach
I started by creating a new Angular project using the Angular CLI. Then, I created a folder structure for the project. After that, I designed the header component. Then, I added the social media list component using the devExtreme library. I customized the social media list component by adding the social media search, filter, paging, and sorting. Finally, I added the add social media component.

## What I have learned
<!-- I have learned how to use the devExtreme library to display data in an Angular application. It was quite challenging to customize the devExtreme library to fit the application's design, but I managed to do it. Tailwind CSS and ::ng-deep was my best friends in this project.  -->
### 1. Utilizing devExtreme Library:
   - Learned how to effectively integrate and use the devExtreme library in an Angular application.
   - Customized the devExtreme components to align with the application's design requirements.
   - Overcame challenges in styling and responsiveness.

### 2. Tailwind CSS and ::ng-deep Usage:
   - Leveraged the power of Tailwind CSS for efficient and responsive styling of application components.
   - Explored the use of `::ng-deep` to apply styles to child components, ensuring a consistent and visually appealing design.

### 3. Implementing Search, Filter, Paging, and Sorting:
   - Implemented advanced features such as search, filter, paging, and sorting functionalities using the devExtreme library.
   - Enhanced the user experience by providing a seamless and intuitive way to interact with the social media list.
